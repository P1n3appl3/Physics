   My python physics engine learning project. 
   Nothing special here yet. Im planning to create a full featured and portable hard body 2D physics engine.

# Progress
	Define and draw circles, rectangles, regular polygons, and irregular polygons
	Detect collisions between any two entities

Using python and pygame for graphics.
