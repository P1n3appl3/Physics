# Physics
   My python physics engine learning project. 
   Nothing special here yet. Im planning to create a full featured and portable hard body 2D physics engine.

# Progress
	Define and draw circles, rectangles, regular polygons, and irregular polygons
	Detect collisions between any two entities
	Timestep simulation at constant speed regardless of cpu speed

Using python and pygame for graphics.
