# Physics
   My python physics engine learning project. 
   Nothing special here yet. Im planning to create a full featured and portable hard body 2D physics engine.

# Progress
	Define and draw circles, rectangles, regular polygons, and irregular polygons
	Detect collisions between any two entities
	Dictate collision logic with groups and masks
	Timestep simulation at constant speed regardless of cpu speed
	Simulate particle collision physics with circles
	Include restitution, friction, gravity, and relative entity gravity

Using python and pygame for graphics.
